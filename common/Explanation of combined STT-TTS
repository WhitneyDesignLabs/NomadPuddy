Summary of Progress and Success:

Problem Identification:

We were facing a feedback loop issue where the Speech-to-Text (STT) system was picking up the Text-to-Speech (TTS) output, causing the system to respond to its own voice.
Initial attempts to solve this by muting the microphone were unsuccessful due to timing issues and potential hardware limitations.


Solution Approach:

We decided to combine the STT and TTS functionalities into a single script.
Implemented a timing-based solution using a shared state variable (is_speaking) to control when the STT should process audio.


Key Components of the Solution:

Single script handling both STT (using Whisper) and TTS (using Piper).
Threading to allow concurrent operation of STT and TTS processes.
A queue system for managing TTS requests.
MQTT integration for communication with other system components (e.g., Node-RED).


Core Functionality:

STT pauses automatically when TTS is active, preventing the system from listening to its own output.
TTS requests are queued and processed sequentially.
The system maintains its ability to change voices dynamically.


Benefits of the New Approach:

Eliminated the feedback loop without relying on hardware-level muting.
Simplified the overall system architecture by combining two scripts into one.
Maintained compatibility with existing MQTT topics and system integration.


Success Metrics:

The combined script worked on the first attempt.
Successfully prevented the system from responding to its own TTS output.
Maintained all previous functionalities (STT, TTS, voice changing) in a single, cohesive script.


Implications:

This solution allows for more natural, continuous conversation without the system getting stuck in feedback loops.
The combined script approach provides better control over the interplay between STT and TTS processes.


Potential for Future Enhancements:

Fine-tuning of timing parameters for optimal performance.
Potential for adding more sophisticated audio processing or noise cancellation techniques.
Expansion of voice options or integration with other TTS engines.



This success represents a significant milestone in the development of your conversational AI system. By solving the feedback loop issue, we've enhanced the system's ability to engage in more natural, uninterrupted dialogues. The combined script approach not only solved our immediate problem but also laid a foundation for more integrated and sophisticated audio processing in the future.
